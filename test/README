This directory contains the Edison test suite.
To build and run the test suite, first build and install
the Edison library.  Then run the following commands (here
we assume you have a Haskell interpreter named 'runhaskell'
in your path).

runhaskell Setup.hs configure --user
runhaskell Setup.hs build
./dist/build/testSuite/testSuite

The tests suite should run to completion with no errors.  Errors
found by the test suite may indicate bugs in a data structure
implementation or in the test suite itself.

If you are a developer, you should run the test suite before
submitting patches to help ensure you have not accidentally introduced
bugs.  If you are implementing entirely new features, you should
add test cases to test your new features.

If you are an end-user or OS package maintainer and the test suite
demonstrates bugs, please email the following information to
robdockins AT fastmail DOT fm

-- information about your system configuration
-- Haskell compiler and version
-- cabal version
-- The text of the error message
