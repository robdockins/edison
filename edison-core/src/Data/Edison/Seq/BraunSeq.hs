--   One-sided Braun sequences.  All running times are as listed in
--   "Data.Edison.Seq" except the following:
--
--   * lview, lcons, ltail*   @O( log n )@
--
--   * rcons, rview, rhead*, rtail*, size   @O( log^2 n )@
--
--   * copy, inBounds, lookup*, update, adjust  @O( log i )@
--
--   * append            @O( n1 log n2 )@
--
--   * concat            @O( n + m log m )@
--
--   * drop, splitAt     @O( i log n )@
--
--   * subseq            @O( i log n + len )@
--
--   * reverseOnto       @O( n1 log n2 )@
--
--   * concatMap, (>>=)  @O( n * t + m log m )@, where @n@ is the length of the input sequence
--                                               @m@ is the length of the output sequence and @t@
--                                               is the running time of @f@
--
--   By keeping track of the size, we could get rcons, rview, rhead*, and rtail*
--   down to @O(log n)@ as well; furthermore, size would be @O( 1 )@.
