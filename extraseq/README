These sequences were part of Martin Holters's master's thesis.
He has provided these for inclusion into Edison, and given explicit
permission to relicense them under the MIT license for inclusion into
Edison.

However, I have not yet taken time to work through the details of
what it would take to incorporate these implementations into the
Edison as it currently stands.  For now, I'm simply checking these
files into the Edison source repository so they are not lost.
