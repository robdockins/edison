<h3>About Edison</h3>
<p>
Edison is a library of purely function data structures for Haskell
originally written by Chris Okasaki.  Conceptually, it consists of two
things:
</p>
<ol>
 <li>A set of type classes defining data the following data structure
     abstractions: "sequences", "collections" and "associative collections"</li>
 <li>Multiple concrete implementations of each of the abstractions.</li>
</ol>

<p>
In theory, either component may be used independently of the other.
</p>

<p>
This release is an update to (hopefully) make Edison easier to use,
mostly by updating Edison to use the most current Haskell tools.
The following major changes have been made since version 1.1, which
was released in 1999.
</p>

<ul>
 <li>Typeclasses updated to use fundeps (by Andrew Bromage)</li>
 <li>Implementation of ternary search tries (by Andrew Bromage)</li>
 <li>Modules renamed to use the hierarchical module extension</li>
 <li>Documentation haddockized</li>
 <li>Source moved to a darcs repository</li>
 <li>Build system cabalized</li>
 <li>Unit tests integrated into a single driver program which exercises
    all the concrete implementations shipped with Edison</li>
 <li>Multiple additions to the APIs (mostly the associated collection API)</li>
</ul>

<p>
Hopefully, these changes will make Edison more accessible than it has
been previously.

<h3>License</h3>
<p>
Edison is released under an MIT style license.  See the
<a href="../COPYRIGHT">COPYRIGHT</a> file for details.
</p>


<h3>Building Edison</h3>

<p>
Edison is distributed as a set of related Cabal packages.
The EdisonAPI package contains the main API typeclass definitions.
The EdisonCore package provides the main concrete implementations;
this package depends on the EdisonAPI package.  The Edison-test
package contains the test suite and depends on both packages.
</p>

<p>
You may either manually invoke cabal for each of the sub-packages
as appropriate, or you may use the included Makefile, which will
build and install the EdisonAPI and EdisonCore packages
automaticly.
</p>

<p>
If you do not have an executable named 'runhaskell' on your search
path, you will need to edit the Makefile and set the RUNHS variable
appropriately (or run the cabal commands manually).
</p>

<p>
If you wish to build the API docs, you will first need to
build the relevant package and type the following command in
the package subdirectory:
</p>

<pre>runhaskell Setup.hs haddock</pre>


<h3>Notes on portability</h3>

<h4>Short version:</h4>

<p>
Edison is expected to work correctly on recent GHC and Hugs (with
extensions enabled).  Other Haskell implementations may also work, but
have not been tested.
</p>


<h4>Longer version:</h4>

<p>
Edison uses a number of extensions beyond Haskell 98, the current
official Haskell standard.  These include:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>Multi-parameter typeclasses</li>
  <li>Functional dependencies</li>
  <li>Undecidable instances</li>
</ul>

<p>
In all cases, these extensions are used to allow the typeclass
abstractions to be expressed.  These extensions are fairly popular
and seem likely to make it in some form into a Haskell standard
(hopefully in the not too distant future).
</p>

<p>
Currently, Edison builds and runs correctly under GHC and Hugs.
More specificly, most development and testing has been done with
GHC 6.4.1, and the test suite builds and runs to completion with no errors.
Most recently, the test suite was built and tested on GHC 6.8.1.
With Hugs (March 2005 release) and the '-98' option, all of the core Edison
data structures should work correctly.  Unfortunately, the test suite will
not load, due to differences in Hugs' and GHC's implementations of 
multi-parameter typeclasses.
</p>

<p>
As the extensions used are not recent developments, I also expect that less
recent versions of GHC and Hugs will also work.  Other implementations
may also work correctly with Edison, but this has not been tested.
</p>


<h3>The Story on Edison Packages</h3>

<p>
Cabal is a nice tool for building and distributing Haskell projects.  However,
it has the slightly undesirable property that the "Package" unit is the atomic
unit of compilation, documentation and of dependency resolution.  In order to
support implementations which have varying external dependencies, Edison has been
split into multiple cabal sub-packages, which cooperate.  The root package is
named 'EdisonAPI' and it contains the typeclass specifications, together with
extensive documentation and a few utility classes.  'EdisonAPI' essentially
represents a design contract.  The 'EdisonCore' package contains core Edison
implementations.  These implementations have no dependencies beyond the standard
libraries.  Other implementation modules are planned: these other modules
may have dependencies on eg, Adiran Hay's AVL tree implementation or Don
Stewart's Fast Packed String, etc.  Additionally there is a unit test package.
Currently it is tied to the 'EdisonCore' package, but in the future it will
provide basic unit testing capabilities for extended implementations as well.
</p>



<h3>Edison Versioning</h3>

<p>
As the maintainer of Edison, I take API stability very seriously.  My goal is
that programs written against Edison will not suffer from version drift.
However, I also wish to allow Edison to incorporate new ideas and evolve into a
better way to use data structures in Haskell.  In order to help accommodate these
somewhat opposing goals, I have adopted the following versioning scheme.  Respect
the versioning scheme, and you should have no compatibility problems.
</p>

<p>
Each Edison release number is composed of four components:
</p>
<pre>

  xxx.yyy.zzz.www
   ^   ^   ^   ^
   |   |   |   |
   |   |   |   +------ patch level
   |   |   +---------- API version number
   |   +-------------- minor version number
   +------------------ major version number

</pre>

<p>
The API version number and/or patch level may be omitted for brevity.  When
omitted, they are assumed to be 0.
</p>

<p>
I have adopted the (pre-2.6) Linux kernel versioning scheme for major and
minor numbers: the major number is incremented at major updates (ie, something
on the order of total API re-engineering or complete rewrites).  Minor numbers
represent "branches" of development.
</p>

<p>
Releases with even minor numbers are "stable" releases (0 is considered even).
For example, the Edison 1.2 release is a stable release. Even numbered releases
will have stable user-visible APIs; my goal is that any program compiled against
an Edison stable release will work correctly for all later Edison releases with
the same major and minor version numbers.  This means that API changes will be
limited to additions.  However, I intend that even additions be rare, and they will
only be considered with compelling evidence that the lack of the feature in question
inhibits desirable use cases.  The user-visible behavior of an implementation will
only be changed if it was originally in violation of the contract (ie, a bug).
</p>

<p><em>*NOTE*</em><br/>
THE EXACT BEHAVIOR OF AMBIGUOUS OPERATIONS IS NOT CONSIDERED USER-VISIBLE BEHAVIOR,
nor is the behavior of unsafe operations when used in violation of their preconditions.
Ambiguous operations may change their behavior in stable releases as long as such
changes still obey the design contract.
</p>

<p>
Releases with odd minor numbers are "development" branches.  Such releases
are branched from the immediately preceding stable release minor number.
For example, the Edison 1.3 development branch will be forked from the Edison 1.2
release family.  No guarantees are made about the user-visible APIs for development
branches.  API operations may be added, deleted, or have the terms of their design
contracts altered in development branches, and implementations may freely change their
behavior.  Eventually development branches are stabilized and transform into the next
even-numbered stable release.
</p>

<p>
For both even and odd minor numbers, the third component represents the "API version".
Any change to the API will cause a bump in the API version number.  For stable branches,
this should be fairly rare; for odd branches, it may occur rather frequently.
</p>

<p>
The fourth component is incremented for each official release whenever the first three
components are not altered.  Two Edison versions which differ only in their patch level
should have identical APIs.
