--
--   The /associative collection/ abstraction includes finite maps, finite
--   relations, and priority queues where the priority is separate from the
--   element.  Associative collections are defined in Edison as a set of eight
--   classes.
--
--   Note that this
--   hierarchy mirrors the hierarchy for collections, but with the addition
--   of 'Functor' as a superclass of every associative collection. See 
--   "Data.Edison.Coll" for a description of the class hierarchy.
--
--   In almost all cases, associative collections make no guarantees about
--   behavior with respect to the actual keys stored and (in the case of
--   observable maps) which keys can be retrieved.  We adopt the convention
--   that methods which create associative collections are /unambiguous/
--   with respect to the key storage behavior, but that methods which can
--   observe keys are /ambiguous/ with respect to the actual keys returned.
--
--   In all cases where an operation is ambiguous with respect to the key,
--   the operation is rendered /unambiguous/ if the @Eq@ instance on keys
--   corresponds to indistinguisability.
