--
--   The /collection/ abstraction includes sets, bags and priority queues
--   (heaps).  Collections are defined in Edison as a set of eight classes.
--
--   All collections assume at least an equality relation of elements, and
--   may also assume an ordering relation.
--
--   The hierarchy contains a root class 'CollX' together with seven
--   subclasses satisfying one or more of three common sub-properties:
--
-- * /Uniqueness/ Each element in the collection is unique (no two
--   elements in the collection are equal).  These subclasses, indicated
--   by the name @Set@, represent sets rather than bags (multi-sets).
--
-- * /Ordering/ The elements have a total ordering and it is possible to
--   process the elements in non-decreasing order. These subclasses,
--   indicates by the @Ord@ prefix, typically represent either priority
--   queues (heaps) or sets\/bags implemented as binary search trees.
--
-- * /Observability/ An observable collection is one in which it is
--   possible to view the elements in a collection.  The @X@ suffix
--   indicates a lack of observability.  This property is discussed is
--   greater detail below.
--
--   Because collections encompass a wide range of abstractions, there is no
--   single name that is suitable for all collection type constructors.
--   However, most modules implementing collections will define a type
--   constructor named either @Bag@, @Set@, or @Heap@.
--
--   /Notes on observability/
--
--   Note that the equality relation defined by the 'Eq' class is not
--   necessarily true equality.  Very often it is merely an equivalence
--   relation, where two equivalent values may be distinguishable by other
--   means.  For example, we might consider two binary trees to be equal
--   if they contain the same elements, even if their shapes are different.
--
--   Because of this phenomenon, implementations of observable collections
--   (ie, collections where it is possible to inspect the elements) are rather
--   constrained.  Such an implementation must retain the actual elements that
--   were inserted.  For example, it is not possible in general to represent an
--   observable bag as a finite map from elements to counts, because even if we
--   know that a given bag contains, say, three elements from some equivalence
--   class, we do not necessarily know /which/ three.
--
--   On the other hand, implementations of /non-observable/ collections have
--   much greater freedom to choose abstract representations of each
--   equivalence class.  For example, representing a bag as a finite map from
--   elements to counts works fine if we never need to know /which/
--   representatives from an equivalence class are actually present.  As
--   another example, consider the 'UniqueHash' class defined in
--   "Data.Edison.Prelude".  If we know that the 'hash' function yields a 
--   unique integer for each equivalence class, then we can represent a
--   collection of hashable elements simply as a collection of integers.  With
--   such a representation, we can still do many useful things like testing for
--   membership; we just can't support functions like 'fold' or 'filter' that
--   require the elements themselves, rather than the hashed values.
